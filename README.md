# Regression using ADMM
Implementing ADMM for solving convex optimization problems such as Lasso, Ridge regression

## Introduction
ADMM works in two steps
  1. Divide <br> 
    a. Break down original problem into small problems <br>
    b. Distribute these small problem to <N> processors / computing resources <br>
    c. Every processor solves the smaller problem
  2. Conquer <br>
    a. Combine solution from \<N\> processors into one
  
## Datasets 
  We have used two datsets namely,
    1. Student Performance Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams) <br>
    2. Heart Disease Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
  
## Our work
  We implemented ADMM based and regular Lasso and Ridge regression models using python.
  We made a comparative study of these models on the provided datasets.
